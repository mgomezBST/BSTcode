Clients like the Federal Government, JetBlue Airways, AAA, and Towers Watson used Trend Integration’s suite of solutions to screen millions of job candidates.

        Mike’s ventures have also included TechTracer Systems, a staffing company focused on placement of science and IT professionals, and The Change Club, a non-profit organization providing free consulting services to other charitable organizations. Earlier in his career, Mike operated his own law practice in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
