    <p class="memberp">Dr. Robert K. Ross, BCBA-D, LABA, CPBA-AP: For the past 38 years, Dr. Ross has worked with individuals and families impacted by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and other developmental challenges. Over the past 30 years, he has worked in one of New England’s largest ASD service providers as the Chief Clinical Officer. In this role he provided clinical leadership and oversight to all treatment staff. He was responsible for developing comprehensive staff training procedures, efficacy monitoring systems and quality assurance mechanisms. Dr. Ross was not limited to clinical programs, as he was actively involved in both clinical treatment systems and overall agency operational systems. This dual role allowed him to develop a unique perspective on both macro level autism treatment issues on a day-to-day level, but also on the management and oversight of a large provider of ASD services. He also oversaw all applied research conducted at the agency, their master’s degree training program and research dissemination efforts. This company was at that time one of the largest presenters of applied ASD instructional efficacy related research at the Association of Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) annual conferences. He has authored or co-authored 20 peer reviewed journal publications related to autism intervention.
<br><br>
        Dr. Ross’s commitment to children with autism is evidenced by the fact that, while in these roles, he continued to maintain an active caseload of direct services to children and families affected by ASD. He has a strong belief that in order to provide and oversee high quality treatment services, it is critical to be actively engaged in working with the individuals who are directly impacted by such services. In keeping with this philosophy, he continues to carry a small case load of clients with whom he works directly. He has dedicated his career to providing the best possible support to the people whose lives and future are impacted by ASD, and ensuring the that highest quality research supported intervention is available to as many people as possible. His new role Biostream Technologies allows him to continue his personal commitment to making high quality intervention available at a scale never before possible.</p>
