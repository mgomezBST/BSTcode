    <p class="memberp">Dr. Suzanne Buchanan is the Executive Director of Autism New Jersey, the largest New Jersey statewide network of parents and professionals dedicated to improving lives of individuals with autism spectrum disorders. Dr. Buchanan is a licensed psychologist and Board Certified Behavior Analyst - Doctoral (BCBA-D). She earned a doctorate in clinical psychology from Long Island University and has worked in the autism field for more than twenty years.
<br><br>
        In her work for Autism New Jersey, Dr. Buchanan provides clinical and operational leadership; disseminates information regarding evidence-based intervention to parents, professionals, and the media; and advises public policy efforts from a clinical perspective. She and her colleagues recently led a successful advocacy initiative to roll back policies that would have decreased the availability of housing for adults with autism.
<br><br>
        Dr. Buchanan also authored a paper on the effectiveness of Applied Behavior Analysis for adults with autism that was part of the justification for removing the age cap on the autism insurance mandate paving the way to a new funding source for treatment for adults with autism. Her interests include family resilience, informed decision-making about autism intervention, and contributing to the development and implementation of state policies that impact the autism community and the professionals who support them.</p>
