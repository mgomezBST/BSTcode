                <p>Our vision is to use a scientific approach to create a new generation of evidence-based, engaging, personalized computer-based assessments, therapies, and training & educational tools informed by physiological and behavioral data. We believe these interventions have the potential to revolutionize their respective fields.</p>

                <p>We are currently focused on developing technologies that are designed to help therapists in their charge to address social skills issues with children on the autism spectrum.  Autism is characterized in part by increased difficulty in social interaction and communication, which can make educational, professional, and personal success more challenging.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Autism is up 275% since 2000 or about 2 million children and prevalence has been rising.</li>
                        <li>Standard of Care (ABA) involves intensive, manual instruction.</li>
                        <li>Therapist shortage: Demand up 1,942% from 2010 to 2020 & turnover rates range from 45% to 75%.</li>
                        <li>Early Treatment works yet waitlists for basic treatment are 2-3 years long!</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>We are passionate about helping children on the autism spectrum improve their social skills because we believe these skills will help them forge more meaningful relationships, achieve their goals, and lead fulfilling lives.</p>

                    Lookware™ is a 25-minute, evidence-based, adaptive, fun, computer program deploying state-of-the art, Gaze-Contingent Eye Tracking (GCET)
<br>
                    This innovative game-based platform delivers high-intensity training while enhancing adherence and deploying a cloud-based, objective data collection, analysis, and reporting function.
<br>
                    Backed by Clinical & Commercial experts (link to team bios) with over 120 years of practical & relevant experience, we believe that our video game therapy has enormous potential to help children on the autism spectrum by enabling them to practice skills in a comfortable environment before applying them in the real world.<br>  The Lookware platform also includes a therapist/teacher/parent/caregiver app that conducts periodic, brief surveys to gather data on how the skills developed and enhanced translate in the real world.
<br>
                    We also believe that to be most effective, such a therapy should be personalized and engaging. That’s why we’re using state-of-the-art technology to develop a game that will tailor the experience to each individual and intelligently adapt in real time. We’re also working hard to create a high-quality experience that includes animations, music, levels, power-ups, and more. After all, therapies are more effective when patients stick with them, and this is no ordinary therapy – it’s a video game, and it’s going to be fun.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="faq4" class="faq-content">
                <p>We are committed to using a scientific approach to make our video game therapy as effective and engaging as possible for children on the autism spectrum. Every aspect of the game, from the specific social skills targeted to the various sensory elements, has been informed by the latest academic literature and tailored specifically toward children on the autism spectrum.</p>
